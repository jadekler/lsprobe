# lsprobe

This repository holds my attempts to connect to [VSCode's LSP](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-3-14) and run [`gopls` commands](https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/commands.md).

It is intended to evolve into a general purpose tool to test running `gopls` commands from a "user" perspective, in order to end-to-end test features in development.

## Running

`go run .`
